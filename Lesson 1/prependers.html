        <h3>Bio</h3>

        <p>
            The Prependers are a quirky four-piece from Orlando, FL. Critics have hailed them as the greatest post-garage-rock band of the last decade. They are currently writing a full length album that's a follow-up to their breakout 2011 album, Top Right Bottom
            Left, and their critically acclaimed EP, Opacity Zero.
