                            <time datetime="1995-02">February 1995</time>
                            , Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for
                            more than 23 years,
                            including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind. His new band, The Scam, formed
                            with
                            Erna on vocals,
                            Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on
                            drums.
                            The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.
                            The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston.
                            Locally popular songs such as "Keep Away" and "Whatever" soon brought them to the top of the hit
                            charts
                            in the Boston/New England area.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many people think the band's name stemmed from Alice in Chains song, but according to Erna,
                            the band's name came from a small and personal incident.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and
                            somebody said, 'It's a godsmack.'
                            The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice In Chains song but didn't really think much about it."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards
                            left
                            upon learning he had a
                            six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences.
                            In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first
                            <abbr>CD</abbr> titled All
                            Wound Up.
                            The <abbr>CD</abbr> was recorded in just three days for $2,600.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area.
                            Eventually Godsmack's <abbr>CD</abbr> landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston
                            radio station <abbr>WAAF</abbr>
                            (<abbr>FM</abbr>).
                            The radio station put "Keep Away" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at
                            the
                            station very quickly.
                            Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the <abbr>CD</abbr> on consignment.
                            Shortly after the success of "Keep Away," Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single
                            titled "Whatever,"
                            which became the new local favorite on <abbr>WAAF</abbr> (<abbr>FM</abbr>).
                            In an interview Sully Erna stated:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time <abbr>WAAF</abbr> picked
                            up the album.
                            All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my
                            bedroom.
                            After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off."

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In mid-1998, Universal/Republic Records signed the band to their label.
                            Joe D'Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer Tommy Stewart, who
                            returned after expressing a desire to be
                            in the band again. The band's first studio recording All Wound Up was re-mastered, and the finished
                            self-titled debut <abbr>CD</abbr> album Godsmack
                            was released to the public six weeks later.
                            This led to the band's first headlining tour, "The Godsmack Tour" with Jim Rose Circus as the
                            opening act.
                            After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at Ozzfest
                            and Woodstock '99.
                            This was followed by a tour in Europe supporting Black Sabbath. Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave
                            the album three out of five stars,
                            stating, "Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age".
                            The album entered the Billboard 200 at number twenty-two, and was certified 4x platinum by the
                            Recording Industry Association of America in 2001 after being initially certified gold in 1999.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns
                            over some of its lyrical content.
                            The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores
                            ordered amended copies of the album.
                            Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker
                            and this is the one and only complaint ...
                            Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective ...
                            We have decided to put a sticker on the record."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped.
                            The album also had four successful singles which were "Whatever," "Keep Away," "Voodoo" and "Bad
                            Religion."

                            In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to The Scorpion King.
                            The motion picture was the third in the Mummy saga, and was a spin-off prequel of the Mummy series.
                            The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled "I Stand Alone" and the song became the number 1
                            single at
                            Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight.
                            It was also used in the game Prince of Persia: Warrior Within.

                            With Shannon Larkin (ex Ugly Kid Joe, Souls at Zero, Wrathchild America, MF Pitbulls) replacing
                            Tommy Stewart,
                            who left due to personal differences for the second time,
                            Godsmack went back into the studio to record a new album that was released in 2003.
                            Faceless debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week,
                            and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States.
                            Faceless managed to beat West Coast nu metal band Linkin Park, with the release of their second
                            studio album Meteora,
                            which dropped to number two on the Billboard 200.
                            Faceless also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the
                            Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks.
                            A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.

                            The lead single "Straight Out of Line" received a Grammy Award nomination for "Best Hard Rock
                            Performance".
                            The award went to Evanescence's single "Bring Me to Life".
                            The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident.
                            However, in a later interview Merrill stated otherwise, making it unclear of how the album's title
                            came to be:

                        <blockquote>
                            "It came from the band's feeling that, despite our radio and sales success, we still flew a bit
                            under the radar".

                            The Other Side, an acoustic EP, was released.
                            The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200; this is a relatively high position for an
                            acoustic EP.
                            It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new
                            acoustic tracks.
                            One new song, "Touché", featured Godsmack's first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John
                            Kosco,
                            who were at that time in the now defunct band Dropbox,
                            The other two new acoustic tracks were "Running Blind" and "Voices".
                            The song "Asleep" is actually an acoustic version of "Awake" from the band's second album Awake.
                            Godsmack shifted from its "heavy" sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on this EP in the same
                            manner Alice in Chains
                            did in the Sap and Jar of Flies EPs,
                            one of many similarities to Alice in Chains for which the band has been criticized.
                            In 2004, Godsmack opened for Metallica's "Madly in Anger with the World tour",
                            and headlined the tour along with Dropbox.
                            Afterwards, in autumn 2004, the band played several acoustic shows to promote The Other Side,
                            while at the same time continuing to open for Metallica.

                    <p>
                        Godsmack has been described as nu metal, heavy metal, post-grunge, hard rock, and alternative metal.
                        The band's primary influences include Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin,
                        Metallica,
                        Pantera and Rush according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola.
                        Erna has cited Layne Staley as his primary influence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall sound of the band's first two albums sound similar to the sound of the Alice in Chains album
                        Dirt.
                        However, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna
                        stating in an interview with Matt Ashare:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "I've just never really heard that in our music".
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        The band's music is often compared to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence.
                        Adrien Begrand of PopMatters states, "Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley's low,
                        guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls" -Erna's vocals also seem to be reminiscent
                        of
                        Metallica's James Hetfield- and, "The band's music is a faithful retread of Jerry Cantrell's churning,
                        tuned-down hard rock".
                        Katherine Turman of Amazon.com states the band has "dark, swirling, commanding music".
                        She also commented on the band's third album Faceless, which "mixes arena rock in the vein of an Alice
                        in Chains",
                        "riff-heavy, layered tunes and sharp, confident bridge-burning lyrics".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Erna's singing style has been stated as "the snarl of James Hetfield",
                        and "composed of dark harmony that sounds a lot like Alice in Chains".
                        Merrill's bass style has been described as "bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb".
                        Larkin's drumming is thought to "worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham".
                        And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as "guitars that sound like percussion instruments".
